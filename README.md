## Idea
AN E- COMMERCE WEBSITE FOR OUR COLEGE SOCIETY STORE WHICH AIMS IN REDUCING THE HUGE QUEUE WE SEE EVERYDAY. IT ALSO HELPS THE STOREKEEPERS TO KNOW WHAT THE STUENT NEEDS AND HELPS STUDENTS TO KNOW WHETHER THE PRODUCT THEY NEED IS ABAILABLE OR NOT.

## Features 
1.The CET Co-operative Store Web Application, streamlining purchases to bypass long waiting times at peak traffic hours.
2.It allows the user to utilise the already deposited caution fund and will enable the user to have a more conveniant way to make purchases
3.It also provides the user to convert Rupees to credits that can be utilised on the app itself
4. It allows the user to check the availability of products in the store
